# The Vault

## Description

The Vault is a Full Stack web application that allows the user to save and store passwords. This password manager can be accessed through the browser and encrypts and stores the user's credentials on a single machine or device, such as your laptop or smartphone. The userâ€™s information is saved in an encrypted file to which they can gain access using their master password. The purpose of this application is for the user to only have to remember the main credential that opens The Vault. This will encourage the user to create stronger password credentials without the fear of forgetting them for future use.
